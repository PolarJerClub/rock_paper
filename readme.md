Marc and Jeremy's Project

Ideas:

-Free play vs Ranked
-Create Ranked Play(Best of 5)
-When ranked is chosen a scoreboard should be displayed starting at 0-0
-Determine a win vs a loss vs a draw
-Win: add 1 to player
-Lose: add 1 to pc
-Draw: do nothing
-When win or lose == 5 break



score = 0
for point in score:
    if tell_player == ask_player:
        score = 0
    elif
